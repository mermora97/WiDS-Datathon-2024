# WiDS-Datathon-2024
This repository contains my source code for the 2024 Women in Data Science ("WiDS") kaggle competition. 

This year's topic addresses a global healthcare inequety challenge, how early metastatic TNBC (Triple Negative Breast Cancer) diagnosis relates to patient demographics.<br>
**Metastatic TNBC** is considered the most aggressive TNBC and requires most urgent and timely treatment. Unnecessary delays in diagnosis and subsequent treatment can have devastating effects in these difficult cancers.

Task: To predict if the patients received metastatic cancer diagnosis within 90 days of screening.<br>
